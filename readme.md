A vanilla JS SPA application that implements the API provided by https://pokeapi.co/

I was interested in how js frameworks, such as vue and react, handle concepts like rehydrating elements at runtime, so I figured I'd try my hand at making similar functionalities for practice.

Most of the fun code is currently in the `/feature/vdom-components/` branch, though that branch is still in development.
